        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p>
          Accessibility ensures that websites are usable by everyone, including
          people with disabilities, making it a critical aspect of web design.
          For this project, we focused on aligning with the Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Using automated tools like Lighthouse
          and SonarLint, we identified areas to improve, such as low contrast,
          missing [alt] attributes, and touch target sizing. However,
          accessibility goes beyond automated checks. Through manual testing and
          thoughtful coding, we implemented features like semantic HTML and ARIA
          attributes. This page highlights the key improvements, coding choices,
          and tools used to achieve our accessibility goals.
        </p>
        <h2>Lighthouse Testing Results</h2>
        <p>
          The Lighthouse audit provided a snapshot of the site’s performance
          across various metrics. While the accessibility score of 96 indicates
          strong adherence to best practices, the audit highlighted a few issues
          that needed to be addressed.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./assets/imgs/lighthouse-score-index.png"
          alt="Lighthouse audit scores: Performance 100, Accessibility 96, Best Practices 100, and SEO 82."
        />
        <h3>Low Contrast Between Text and Background</h3>
        <p>
          One issue involved insufficient contrast on buttons, such as the
          "subscribe" button. Low contrast makes it difficult for users with
          visual impairments to read text. We adjusted the color palette to
          ensure all text met the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
          for contrast ratios.
        </p>

          src="./assets/imgs/accessibility-contrast.PNG"
          alt="Accessibility audit screenshot highlighting insufficient color contrast and small touch targets."
        />
        <h3>Touch Targets Too Small or Close Together</h3>
        <p>
          Certain clickable elements, such as navigation links, were flagged for
          insufficient size and spacing. This could make them difficult to use
          on touch devices, especially for users with motor impairments. We
          updated the CSS to increase padding and margins around touch targets.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./assets/imgs/accessibility-touch-targets.PNG"
          alt="Screenshot of an accessibility audit scoring 92/100. Issues identified include insufficient color contrast for a 'subscribe' button and inadequate size or spacing for touch targets on links labeled 'teknologi' and 'no-underline."
        />
        <p></p>
        <h2>Activity.html accessibility</h2>
        <h3>Missing [alt] Attributes for Images</h3>
        <img
          src="assets/imgs/accessibility-activity-min.webp"
          alt="Screenshot of an accessibility audit scoring 86/100. Issues identified include elements missing [alt] attributes and <frame> or <iframe> elements lacking a title. Recommendations highlight the importance of improving semantic controls for better support with assistive technologies like screen readers."
        />
        <p>
          Several images on the site were flagged for lacking [alt] attributes,
          which are essential for screen readers to describe the content of an
          image. For example, images with classes like img-styler and
          img-vertical did not include descriptive alternate text. To resolve
          this, we ensured that informative images received appropriate [alt]
          attributes.
        </p>
        <h3>Aria-label</h3>
        <img
          src="./assets/imgs/accessibility-activity-link-name.PNG"
          alt="Lack of [alt] attributes, and some links lack discernible names, such as a 'to-the-top-button.' Recommends adding descriptive [alt] text and meaningful link names for screen reader accessibility."
        />
        <p>
          Some interactive elements, like the "to-the-top-button," lacked
          meaningful names, making them inaccessible to screen readers. We added
          descriptive aria-label attributes and ensured all links had clear,
          visible text where possible.
        </p>
        <h2>SonarLint</h2>
        <img
          src="./assets/imgs/sonarLint.png"
          alt="SonarLint extension for VSCode"
        />
        <p>
          Throughout the project, we used SonarLint to ensure our code adhered
          to WCAG accessibility standards. SonarLint provided real-time feedback
          during development, highlighting potential issues such as missing
          [alt] attributes, insufficient color contrast, and improper semantic
          structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          SonarLint integrates seamlessly into the IDE and highlights potential
          problems, such as missing attributes or improper syntax, before the
          code is committed. In this example, SonarLint flagged an
          &lt;iframe&gt; without a "title" attribute, helping ensure the site
          adheres to accessibility best practices. By addressing these issues
          early, we maintained cleaner and more accessible code throughout the
          project.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./assets/imgs/sonarLint-example.png"
          alt="SonarLint warning for an <iframe> element missing a title attribute. The warning suggests adding a title to improve accessibility, ensuring screen readers can describe the iframe's purpose."
        />
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Accessibility is not just a technical requirement but a vital aspect
          of creating an inclusive digital experience for all users. By
          leveraging tools like Lighthouse and SonarLint and applying thoughtful
          manual fixes, we addressed key issues and improved the usability of
          the site. While automated testing provided valuable insights, manual
          testing ensured that all users, regardless of ability, can access and
          interact with the content effectively. Accessibility is an ongoing
          commitment, and these steps are part of a broader effort to build
          universally usable websites.
