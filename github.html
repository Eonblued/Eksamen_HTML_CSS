      <h1>GitHub Usage</h1>
      <p>When working with software development, scripting, markup design or other development projects, it's important to use a tool to manage the cooperation process. Git has for years been, and is still, the industry standard tool for this purpose.</p>
      <p>We've hosted our source code on GitHub and made heavy use of branching to divide up the work properly between.</p>
      <p>Using Git in a collaborative project is a great way to track changes and manage collaboration, but it also comes with it's fair share of challenges. This is especially true when you're not that used to using git, it can be a bit daunting to learn.</p>
      <p>Throughout this project, we've had to deal with merge conflicts, reverting commits, and mismatching local and remote files.</p>
      <p>All things considered, we're very happy with how using git has worked out in this project, and how it has allowed us to simultaneously implement features that modify the same files (relatively) smoothly. Below you can see and read about some of the things we've had to deal with while developing this webpage.</p>
