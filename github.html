        <h2>Foreword</h2>
        <p>
          When working with software development, scripting, markup design or
          other development projects, it's important to use a tool to manage the
          cooperation process. Git has for years been, and still is, the
          industry standard tool for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've hosted our source code on GitHub and made heavy use of branching
          to divide up the work properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using Git in a collaborative project is a great way to track changes
          and manage collaboration, but it also comes with it's fair share of
          challenges. This is especially true when you're not that used to using
          git, it can be a bit daunting to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, we've had to deal with merge conflicts,
          reverting commits, and mismatching local and remote files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, you can see some extracts from our git history that show some
          of the challenges we faced during development of this webpage, as well
          as how git has been invaluable for cooperative development.
        </p>

          Extract 1: Using branches to work simultaneously on the same files

        </picture>
        <p>
          Above, you can see a picture showing some of our git history. The
          picture shows how four people worked on the project at the same time,
          and how git helped us manage the changes. By using branching, all four
          people created their own copy of the source code to work on, all
          connected in the git repository. After we divided up the work, we were
          able to work on the project simultaneously as a group, by creating
          different branches. This was an efficient way to handle parts of the
          project, especially early on. The four different branches were all
          eventually merged back into main, and changes from all team members
          are present in the final product. This was done using pull requests
          and merge commits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using this system, we were able to divide and conquer the project and
          implement features in parallel. Sometimes we further divided up
          features originally assigned to one branch, and used the same
          branch-implement-merge workflow on that branch before the changes went
          into main. This way, we could be flexible in quickly assigning parts
          of a workload, and further divide it up as needed.
        </p>

          />
        </picture>
        <p>
          In the above picture, you can see an extract from our git history. It
          shows the complete history of a feature branch "studieOppbygging" from
          start to finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          The branch in question is shown as a yellow line, with a series of
          commits, including one that has been highlighted with a darker color.
          At the very bottom of the image you can see where the branch was
          created(circled in red) from main(the blue line at the left of the
          image). The creator of the branch made a few commits, and then set up
          a pull request to merge the branch back into main. This has been our
          workflow for most changes made to the project. In this case, there
          were merge conflicts. Therefore, we used the following method:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Implement intermediary changes made to main into the feature
            branch(merge main into feature).
          </li>
          <li>Ensure functionality of both main and feature is maintained.</li>
          <li>
            Merge the feature branch into main, as they are now compatible.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is commonly referred to as a merge commit.</p>
        <p>
          As per policy, several team members review all pull requests to main
          before they are merged. A reviewer noticed some problems introduced by
          the merge commit and attempted to fix them in the highlighted commit
          "Reverted some bad changes" (NOT a git revert). Upon this change, the
          pull request was reviewed again and a different reviewer discovered
          that the highlighted commit introduced a different problem. As such,
          the following commit is a revert that undoes these changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this, some minor fix commits where added addressing the original
          issue in the merge from main to feature. Again, the feature branch
          received another merge commit from main for some intermediary changes.
          Finally, the pull request was approved and the feature branch was
          merged into main and deleted.
        </p>
        <h2>Change 1: A typical feature commit</h2>
        <div class="scrollable-img">
          <img
            src="assets/imgs/git commit 1.png"
            alt="A feature commit adding plus/minus icons to some expandable boxes."
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Typically, a feature commit would look like the one above. This commit
          adds a specific, contained feature explained by a short commit
          message.
        </p>
        <h2>Change 2: A simple fix commit to main</h2>
        <div class="scrollable-img">
          <img
            src="assets/imgs/git commit 2.png"
            alt="A fix commit to main branch that adds some hyperlinks that were previously placeholders."
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          While typically seen as a bad idea, we decided it was okay to commit
          directly to main if the change was small and very simple. For example
          ,the above commit shows some hyperlinks were added to replaced
          previously used placeholders. This type of fix does not affect the
          site in any meaningful way that would break anything, and doesn't
          really need it's own pull request in this case. (In a small team with
          a small change like this, it's not a big deal.)
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          All things considered, we're very happy with how using git has worked
          out in this project, and how it has allowed us to simultaneously
          implement features that modify the same files (relatively) smoothly.
