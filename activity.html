            Bouldering is the purest form of climbing-a captivating blend of
            strenght, intuition, and movement. With no ropes, climbers face the
            raw essence of rock, trusting only in their skill and focus. Each
            route, or "problem," becomes a mystery to unravel, offering a
            journey that's both physical and profoundly meditative.

            Indoor bouldering is an exploration of crafted stone, where climbers
            seek the rhythm hidden in each handhold and foothold. Under colorful
            walls and quiet focus, it's a journey inward, testing strength,
            creativity, and flow. Each route becomesa story, inviting climbers
            to unlock secrets held within the contours of the climb.

        <p class="gradingText indentUni1">
          Bouldering grades are used to indicate the difficulty of climbing
          problems, helping climbers gauge which routes match their skill level
          and track their progress. These grading systems consider factors like
          strength, technique, balance, and problem-solving required for a
          climb. Bouldering uses two main grading systems to indicate
          difficulty: the Color Grading System and the V-Grading System.
        </p>
        <div class="colorGradeText columnLeft">
          <h3>Color grading</h3>
          <p>
            In gyms, the Color Grading System often uses tape or holds of
            specific colors to represent difficulty levels, typically
            progressing from easy (e.g., white or yellow) to very hard (e.g.,
            black or red). In Oslo we use the grading system shown in the table
            below.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="vGradeText columnRight">
          <h3>V-grading</h3>
          <p>
            This system varies by gym. The V-Grading System is used worldwide,
            especially outdoors. Starting at V0 for beginners, it increases with
            difficulty (V1, V2, etc.), with the hardest climbs currently
            reaching V17. Each "V" grade reflects a notable step up in
            technical, physical, and mental challenges.

          <p class="textIndoor textPlacement">
            Outdoor bouldering is the art of climbing untamed rock, a dance with
            nature's raw edges. Without ropes, climbers embrace each unique
            boulder "problem", drawing on instinct, strength, and flow. It's a
            powerful, grounding pursuit—an invitation to connect with the earth
            and unlock its hidden paths through pure movement.

        <p class="equipmentText">
          Proper equipment is crucial in bouldering, enhancing both safety and
          performance. It supports climbers in maintaining grip, stability, and
          confidence on challenging routes, allowing them to focus fully on
          technique and progression. Quality gear minimizes risks and maximizes
          the enjoyment and freedom of each climb.

          <p>
            Climbing shoes are essential for providing precise footwork,
            support, and grip on challenging surfaces. They enhance performance,
            ensuring better control and comfort while tackling different types
            of climbs and terrain.

          <p>
            Bouldering mats, or crash pads, are crucial for outdoor climbing,
            providing safety by cushioning falls. They protect climbers from
            injury, offering peace of mind and allowing focus on the climb
            itself.

          <p>
            Chalk and chalk bags are essential for climbers, helping to keep
            hands dry and improve grip. Chalk absorbs sweat, reducing slippage,
            while the bag provides easy access during climbs, ensuring
            consistent performance.
