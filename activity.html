                <p class="infoBox">
                    Bouldering is the purest form of climbing-a captivating blend
                    of strenght, intuition, and movement. With no ropes, climbers
                    face the raw essence of rock, trusting only in their skill and 
                    focus. Each route, or "problem," becomes a mystery to unravel, 
                    offering a journey that's both physical and profoundly meditative.
