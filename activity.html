            Bouldering is the purest form of climbing-a captivating blend of
            strenght, intuition, and movement. With no ropes, climbers face the
            raw essence of rock, trusting only in their skill and focus. Each
            route, or "problem," becomes a mystery to unravel, offering a
            journey that's both physical and profoundly meditative.

            Outdoor bouldering is the art of climbing untamed rock, a dance with
            nature's raw edges. Without ropes, climbers embrace each unique
            boulder "problem", drawing on instinct, strength, and flow. It's a
            powerful, grounding pursuit—an invitation to connect with the earth
            and unlock its hidden paths through pure movement.

        <p class="equipmentText">
          Proper equipment is crucial in bouldering, enhancing both safety and
          performance. It supports climbers in maintaining grip, stability, and
          confidence on challenging routes, allowing them to focus fully on
          technique and progression. Quality gear minimizes risks and maximizes
          the enjoyment and freedom of each climb.

          <img class="boulderImg" src="assets/imgs/shoes.jpg">
          <p>
            Climbing shoes are essential for providing precise footwork,
            support, and grip on challenging surfaces. They enhance performance,
            ensuring better control and comfort while tackling different types
            of climbs and terrain.

          <p>
            Bouldering mats, or crash pads, are crucial for outdoor climbing,
            providing safety by cushioning falls. They protect climbers from
            injury, offering peace of mind and allowing focus on the climb
            itself.

          <p>
            Chalk and chalk bags are essential for climbers, helping to keep
            hands dry and improve grip. Chalk absorbs sweat, reducing slippage,
            while the bag provides easy access during climbs, ensuring
            consistent performance.
